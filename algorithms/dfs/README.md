# dfs

-   Depth first graph traversal algorithm
-   Returns DFS forest in the form of arrival and departure array

## Time Complexity

-   $O(V+E)$

## Notes

-   Solve recursively, make helper function that takes in time, visited, arrival, and departure arrays
-   Helper function should return time
